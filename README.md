## Welcome to Teamup App Repo

Now that you are here, I guess I have to explain what the repo is all about! This repo contains teamup app, an app for managing todo list between small teams easily.

### How to get started

You need to register with a valid email, verify your email account and login. Once you are logged in you will need to either create a new project card (A project you are working that contains your list of todos) or join one.
You can chat with you team mates and . . . you can leave the card too

### Get started how?
